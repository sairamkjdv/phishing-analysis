# Task 2 – Phishing Email Analysis

## Objective 
To analyze a Phishing Email Sample

---

## Sample Phishing Email Used
Content extracted from a publicly available PayPal-themed phishing attempt (included in `phishing-email.txt`).

---

## Phishing Indicators

### 1. Sample Email
Realistic phishing email used targeting PayPal users.

### 2. Spoofed Sender Address
- **Email**: `services@paypal-accounts.com`
- **Actual PayPal Domain**: `paypal.com`
- The domain is spoofed using a lookalike pattern.

### 3. Email Header Analysis (Customized Simulation)
The email header was customized to simulate delivery to `alex@flux.com` to create a realistic phishing analysis scenario. Below are the simulated header results:

```
Delivered-To: alex@flux.com
Return-Path: <services@paypal-accounts.com>
Received: from phishing-mailer.fakehost.ru ([198.51.100.23])
        by mail.example.com with ESMTP id 9sdf9sd8f7sdf
        for <alex@flux.com>; Tue, 04 Aug 2025 11:15:00 +0530
Received-SPF: fail (example.com: domain of services@paypal-accounts.com does not designate 198.51.100.23 as permitted sender) client-ip=198.51.100.23;
Authentication-Results: mail.example.com;
        spf=fail smtp.mailfrom=services@paypal-accounts.com;
        dkim=fail header.d=paypal-accounts.com;
        dmarc=fail header.from=paypal-accounts.com
```

SPF, DKIM, and DMARC validation failed, indicating a spoofed and unauthenticated sender.

### 4. Suspicious Links or Attachments
- Button: **Confirm Your Information**
- Likely leads to a phishing page impersonating PayPal.

### 5. Urgent/Threatening Language
- “Your account will be permanently disabled”
- “You have 24 hours to solve the problem”

### 6. Mismatched URLs
- Display text appears legitimate but likely redirects to a malicious site.

### 7. Spelling/Grammar Issues
- Minor awkward grammar: “confirm all of your account details…”

### 8. Summary of Phishing Traits

| Indicator                     | Present | Notes                 |
|-------------------------------|---------|-----------------------|
| Spoofed sender                | Yes     | Fake domain           |
| Email header issues           | Yes     | SPF/DKIM fail         |
| Suspicious links              | Yes     | Button present        |
| Urgent language               | Yes     | Fear-based tactics    |
| Mismatched URLs               | Yes     | Link likely masked    |
| Spelling/grammar issues       | Minor   | Some awkward phrasing |
| Social engineering tactics    | Yes     | Uses fear & urgency   |

## Tools Suggested
- [Google Header Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/messageheader/): for .eml files
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/): Check link safety
- [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com/): Investigate domain reputation

## Learning Outcome
Learned to analyze phishing emails by identifying spoofing, social engineering, and technical red flags using both visual inspection and header analysis techniques.
